//		Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.
		
//		Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything
//		is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.
		
//		Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language
		
//		The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.
		
//		The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, 
//		for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
		
//		OBJECT:
//		Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc.
//		Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. 
//		An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
		
//		CLASS:
//		Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
//		A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.
		
//		Inheritance
//		When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. 
//		It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
		
//		Polymorphism
//		If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.
//		For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.
//		In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
//		Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.
		
//		Abstraction
//		Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. 
//		For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
//		In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
		
//		Encapsulation
//		Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
//		For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
//		A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members
//		are private here.
		
//		Coupling
//		Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. 
//		If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling
//		In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field. 
//		You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.
		
//		Cohesion
//		Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. 
//		A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method
		
		
//		Association
//		Association represents the relationship between the objects.
		
//		One to One
//		One to Many
//		Many to One, and
//		Many to Many

//		Aggregation
//		Aggregation is a way to achieve Association. Aggregation represents the relationship 
//		where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. It represents the weak relationship between objects.
//		It is also termed as a has-a relationship in Java. Like, inheritance represents the is-a relationship. 
//		It is another way to reuse objects.
		
		
//		Composition
//		The composition is also a way to achieve Association. The composition represents the relationship where one object contains
//		other objects as a part of its state. There is a strong relationship between the containing object and the dependent object. 
//		It is the state where containing objects do not have an independent existence. If you delete the parent object, 
//		all the child objects will be deleted automatically.
